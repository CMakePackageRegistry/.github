# CMake Package Repository
This repository will contain a community authored set of CMake packages that are compatible with the current ExternalProject mechanisms:
 - [`CPM`](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) - CMake's missing package manager as a thin wrapper around the `FetchContent` module 
 - [`FetchContent`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) - Configure time support for the `ExternalProject` module
 - [`ExternalProject`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html) - Creates a custom target to drive download, update/patch, configure, build, install and test steps of an external project.
